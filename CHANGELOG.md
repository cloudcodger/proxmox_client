# Change log

# version 2.0.4

- Role `lxc` changes.
    - Changed `lxc_cts`, by adding `description` to the optional items. Fixed it to be like the one for `cloud_init`.

# version 2.0.3

- Both `cloud_init` and `lxc` roles changes.
    - Renamed current highest free variables to fix conflict between roles.

# version 2.0.2

- Both `cloud_init` and `lxc` roles changes.
    - Renamed handlers so playbooks that call both roles call the correct one.
      Since these are the same, it made no difference, but a future change
      expose the issue.
    - Added adding hostkeys to known_hosts file.
      When get IP from DHCP and needing to connect via it,
      leaves the possibility that you will have a conflicting entry
      that prevents the wait_for_connection from connecting.
      Which requires using `-vvv` to debug.
    - Added variable to bypass the `wait_for_connection`.
